## Description 
The Work Day Scheduler was developed in order to create a schedule of your own and save that schedule in timeblocks. The schedule will be saved in local storage and will remain after refreshing the page. Timeblocks are color coded whether it is past, present, or future. Grey is past, Red is present, and Green is Future.
